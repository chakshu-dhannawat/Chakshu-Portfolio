      <description>Did this project under the guidance of Professor Dr. Anil Kumar Tiwari from IIT Jodhpur. The motivation of this project was to create a software which would assist in automated detection of retinal diseases taking the images of the retinas as input.
 Led a team of 3 members and implemented various deep learning algorithms related to Hypertensive Retinopathy detection. Implemented Retinal Vessel Segmentation and worked on image enhancement algorithms. Analyzed differentImage Classification models like VGG16, ResNet50, for detecting diseases from the images of the retinas.</description>
