      <description>I was interested in algorithmic trading, and thus started tish project to understand how well Machine Learning can be used to predict future values of stocks/cryptocurrency. This project involved implementing various algorithms for predicting future prizes of Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin price is volatile and has a lot of variation, I was not able to get good results at first, but after using models having complex architecture, and having attention mechanisms, I was able to develop models which gave good results.</description>
