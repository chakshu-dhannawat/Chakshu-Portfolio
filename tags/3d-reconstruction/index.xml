      <description>This is not a finished project, instead something which I have worked on. I had researched various algorithms for 3d reconstruction. The different algorithms implemented were:
 NeRF, Used multiple 2d images of a object and also the camera angles/poses at which the 2d images were captured to generate a single 3d object. PIFuHD from facebook. Used to create 3d models from single human images.  You can find more similar repositories on my github profile.</description>
