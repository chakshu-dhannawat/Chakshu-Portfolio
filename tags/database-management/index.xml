      <description>This was a course project under Dr. Suchetana Chakraborty, IIT Jodhpur. Although this is not relevant to Machine Learning, but this project taught me many necessary lessons. I learnt about various ways in which servers work, different scheduling policies and ways in which they affect server performance.
This may be helpful while designing large api&amp;rsquo;s or deploying machine learning models on servers, As we need to handle multiple requests at a single time, thus ensuring the most optimal server architecture will be able to handle more users.</description>
